GS1 and HIBCC formatted UDIs do not currently convey the DIN element.\n\n*Note to balloters: The Ordesr and Observations Workgroup has not yet determined whether the Device resource will include Devices of Human (or other) Origin (tissue, blood, etc.) and so the need for Donation Identification number is currently being met through this extension.  If it is determined a separate resource is to be used for Devices of Human (or other) Origin (tissue, blood, etc.)  then this extension may be deprecated in the future.
