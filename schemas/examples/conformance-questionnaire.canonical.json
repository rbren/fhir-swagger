For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in [Using Profiles]{profiling.html#profile-uses}. Supported profiles are different to the profiles that apply to a particular resource in rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that does? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).  Typical supported profiles cross resource types to describe a network of related resources, so they are listed here rather than by resource. However, they do not need to describe more than one resource.","type":"display"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-allowedResource","valueCode":"StructureDefinition"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-referenceFilter","valueString":"subject=$subj&patient=$subj&encounter=$encounter"}],"linkId":"Conformance.profile.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"Profiles for use cases supported","type":"reference"}],"linkId":"Conformance.profile","repeats":true,"required":false,"type":"group"},{"item":[{"text":"Multiple repetitions allow definition of both client and / or server behaviors or possibly behaviors under different configuration settings (for software or requirements statements).","type":"display"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"A definition of the restful capabilities of the solution, if any.","type":"display"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"string"}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).","type":"display"},{"linkId":"Conformance.rest.id.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)","type":"string"}],"linkId":"Conformance.rest.id","repeats":true,"required":false,"type":"group"},{"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element.
